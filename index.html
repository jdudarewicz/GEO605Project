                        When initially approaching this project, this quote from the Stockholm Environment Institute inspired the direction I would take in responding to Simpsons editorial - that a sovereign, traditional lifestyle is attainable for First Nations for a low cost. My approach involves particularly investing in efficient environmentally friendly homes to tackle the continuing housing crisis (Angus), as well as suggesting ideas to make housing more adaptable to changing conditions particularly in the wake of the rising threat of climate change (Stockholm Environment Institute). For the first portion of this project, I will directly respond to Simpson’s editorial in which I will be arguing why I believe his perspective is flawed. Particularly: a majority of aboriginal Canada is not living in a dream palace; a low cost, traditional, sustainable way of living is attainable on reserve; and why it makes sense for communities like Attawapiskat to remain where they are even with external risk factors. Then, I will be defining what I believe constitutes northern sustainability. Finally, I will discuss how I believe a redux in northern housing could improve environmental, economic, and social factors of living in the north.

                        Historically, the land that First Nations occupy now essentially is a government sanctioned displacement, meaning conditions from within them are less than ideal (Hanson). This lead to disruptions in First Nations, where social networks and kinship systems were disrupted in order to bring together arbitrary families into one community (Hanson). Aboriginal families tend to be extensive and complex, and the housing traditionally found on First Nations is not built to accommodate that, instead modeled after the typical American family (Hanson). These factors combined with marginalization from the capitalist economy, discriminatory legislation, and reduction of traditional lands, mean practices like fishing and hunting were not viable to support a First Nations family and result in poverty on reserves (Hanson).

                        The end result of reserves in their current form is that many of them suffer in extreme poverty due to the above highlighted external factors. For example, highlighted in the video to the left, Attawapiskat First Nation is suffering from a horrendous housing crisis. Many residents within this First Nation are living in overcrowded shacks and tents without a proper connection to electricity, a lack of running water, poor to non-existent insulation, and inadequate disposal of excreta; dumping human waste into ditches along the road (Angus). This results in a decrease of the communities overall health, increasing the risk of infectious diseases of the: respiratory tract, digestive tract; colds, ear infections, strep throat, sinus infections, bronchitis, along with other illnesses (Angus). As well, mental illnesses like depression and anxiety disorders run rampant just from living within these makeshift quarters (Angus). Regarding the more 'Americanized' dwellings, overcrowding, exposed fire stoves, and failing home materials lead to exposure to molds, high risk of fire and burns (Angus).

                        Where Simpson is incorrect lies in the idea that many Aboriginal Canadians are living in an intellectual dream palace- many are well aware of their circumstance. Yet, either through external factors enforced by socioeconomics, cultural genocide, social disruptions though legislation like the Indian Act, or economic and environmental challenges within the communities themselves (Hanson), there is little they can do to combat this as a community alone due to being overwhelmed by all these factors together.

                        As well, there are a plethora of reasons First Nations may want to live on reserve. Visiting the idle no more website, many reserves are based on culturally significant land (even if not spanning the entirety of land claims) where remaining within them preserves sovereignty, promotes protection of the land and waters from corporate pollution, as well as providing a space to honor traditions. These reserves have blossomed into a space where Aboriginal communities maintain their sense of community and cultural ties to continue their legacy (Hanson). They are free to practice cultural customs and promote teachings within reserve lands ideally without influence from European ideology and interference (Hanson). Disregarding the blatant issues that reserve living brings, they are one of the last beacons to preserve Aboriginal culture.

Without a wage economy beyond these “traditional” ways, the path lies clear to dependence on money from somewhere else, namely government, which, in turn, leads to the lassitude and pathologies that plague too many aboriginal communities  ”

                        Prior to the intervention of European cultures, aboriginals had little difficulties living off of the land. Regarding access to foods, percentages varied between First Nations due to differing environments but plants, meats, and fish were staples of a native diet (Government of Canada). Game was easily hunted with spears, bows, and arrows, as well as traps and snares (Government of Canada). Northern hunters adapted to harsh environments by developing advanced routing fences to stampede animals into traps (Government of Canada). The Haudenosaunee were known to even grow crops like corn, beans, and squash, and would frequently relocate to grow in more fertile lands once current grounds were exhausted (Government of Canada). Plains First Nations primarily hunted buffalo, which was ingrained into their culture for thousands of years (Government of Canada). Food preservation was even a consideration- many meats, fish, and berries were dried in the summer, and within winter months stored up in trees with stripped bark to protect against scavengers (Government of Canada). The main takeaway is that prior to the intervention of Europeans, nomadic and settled First Nations could easily and comfortably survive on the lands existing food resources.

                        As for housing, it depended on whether a First Nation was nomadic or permanently resided. For nomadic First Nations, homes were built from either portable or easily erected materials to form tipis (Government of Canada). For more permanent nations, they generally opted to build structures like longhouses, Pacific Nations opted for more red cedar home-like structures, or within pit houses; a pit approximately two meters deep and six to twelve meter covered and insulated (Government of Canada). While many options were not as shielded as the American homes of current reservations, they were extremely in tune with the needs of the First Nation utilizing them and applied to cultures and customs surrounding them.

                        The issue with traditional living within the modern day revolves around how European settlers have interfered with the abilities of First Nations to continue on with their traditional ways of life. Among the largest points of contention are traditional land claims- many First Nations believe the federal government has unfairly taken or promised land and under delivered (Parrott and McCue). As well, modern day industrial activities interfere with the environment surrounding First Nations. For example, the 1002 Lands of the National Wildlife Refuge, home to the Porcupine Caribou Reproductive Lands, were recently opened to Oil and Gas drilling by the Republican Senate, meaning the Porcupine Caribou are at risk to effectively reproduce (Global Affairs Canada). This herd is one of particular importance to many First Nations in the area as it is both culturally and nutritionally significant, and is currently at high risk from habitat destruction (“Habitat”). While human nature is about adaptation, it is ridiculous to expect First Nations to adapt to such a cultural shift that was brought over by European settlers.

                    <p>
                        Directly addressing Simpsons point, I believe that there should be increased cooperation between the government and First Nations to help instill a traditional way of living if wanted by the community. While some may abuse this help, and potentially perpetuate lassitude, there is an aspect of obligation to provide for First Nations and ensure they can continue to operate to a traditional capacity. With the arrival of European settlers and the formation of Canada itself, we robbed these Nations of their land and nonconsensually forced a new way of living upon them they may not have asked for. We expect them to participate within the economy that we cultivate, yet deal them with a bad hand through systemic disadvantages like an uprooting of their culture. I believe this can be done through understanding and respect- through honoring their traditional land claims (Parrott and McCue) to the best of our abilities to allow them to live within a more traditional context, as well as providing a healthy level of economic support to fill in any gaps that may occur due to the modern need to participate in the world economy. Furthermore, a solution in which I will detail later into the website, is the introduction of efficient, safe, economically sensible, adaptable housing to revitalize northern living into a modern context.

                        This comment is tonedeaf to the context of why communities like Attawapiskat would want to remain in their communities, even with the issues Simpson highlights above, among others like mental health challenges (D. Taylor) and boil advisories (Porter). Primarily, as discussed in depth above, this land is tied to their traditional lands so they should not be expected to move, and historical roots in the land run deep (D. Taylor). As well, historically Attawapiskat (like other First Nations) has had a history of being told to relocate by settlers in order to then exploit land and resources that natives benefited from (D. Taylor). Furthermore, it ignores the economic cost of moving into a different community- particularly if everyone is leaving. Who would foot the cost of housing that is essentially useless when everyone in town leaves? Finally, Neal Ostamus, a member of the Neskantaga First Nation addresses the racism and dangers encountered by trying to integrate into a city from a reserve:

                        Another member of the Neskantaga First Nation, Tamara Slipperjack, echoes this sentiment. At 13 years old, even she can sense the racism directed towards her and how uncomfortable that makes her feel (Porter). While I personally believe that racism should not be keeping First Nations out of cities, for those the racism is directed at it is absolutely a factor into why they would want to stay in their communities.

                        Overall, it’s fairly obvious Jeffery Simpson seems to miss the mark when it comes to addressing issues gravely affecting First Nations and why the solutions he poses are not contextually aware. These were addressed through looking into why communities like Attawapiskat chose to remain on reserve, why and how traditional, sustainable living is attainable on reserve (to also be explored further), and that it is untrue that first nations members are living in a dream palace when living on reserve.

                        Finally, we can give a concrete definition to sustainability within a Northern context consisting of ideas above as well as traditional ideas of sustainability.

                </div>
                <div class="col-12 mt-3">
                    <p>
                        A general definition of sustainability, by the Oxford Learner's Dictionary, is:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>the use of natural products and energy in a way that does not harm the environment</li>
                            <li>the ability to continue or be continued for a long time</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the context of Northern communities, both sections of the definition are applicable. Being a steward to the natural in Northern Canada can perpetuate sustainability and allow future generations to enjoy both the nature and resources that those regions provide. As well, with a changing climate the north is particularly affected, so sustainability within the area is focused on its longevity to allow communities and ecosystems in the area to remain for a continued, long period of time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As well, sustainability within a Northern context should involve adaptations to change where necessary, like highlighted in the Stockholm Environment Institute’s “Into the Blue” report. Failing to adapt to changes will result in communities being left behind.

                        To tackle sustainability in Northern communities, I am posing a solution focused particularly on addressing the ongoing housing crises in many First Nations communities. Starting with housing, we can address environmental, economic, and social factors of living within the north.

                        The main inspiration for sustainable living involves the principle of tiny living. Living in a dorm room with approximately 100 square-footage of living space, I understand how efficient well-thought out space can be when purpose is applied. Obviously, my needs are very different to that of someone who lives in the North- my space is built for a single person to live in, versus the needs of a First Nation to house an entire community. As well, I live within a city with convenient access to grocers, education, and transportation which doesn’t exist in any community outside of a major city. I still believe that select principles of living within efficient, tiny-home like housing can apply to those living within the North.

                    <p>
                        First, lets cover the principles of efficient home living. While no set rules apply, a post by Liz on the blog “I Spy Plum Pie” goes over a couple staples of tiny homes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Have a purposeful space for everything</li>
                            <li>Utilize multi-purpose essential products</li>
                            <li>Make use of outdoor spaces</li>
                        </ol>

                    <p>
                        We can expand even further on these principles by introducing ideas involving environmental, economic, and social factors more suitable First Nations living while introducing aspects of sustainability:
                    </p>

                        <li>Utilize materials already available within the environment, or that are simple to transport in, or are are already transported in</li>
                        <li>Suitable to the harsh, changing conditions of the north</li>
                        <li>Modular, can be combined to create adaptable spaces to fit together families and communities</li>

                        Base design: shipping container home
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Many First Nation members already receive deliveries of goods through means of a shipping container shipment, where a container they own is filled with items they order. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The idea is to turn these shipping containers into full fledged homes. Why? 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-12">

                        They can be standalone, or combined together to make larger structures (“14 Things to Know About Building with Shipping Containers”).

                        A conventional wood-framed home on reserve can cost between $200-$300/sqft (Ross). A shipping container home can be manufactured for half of that amount (Ross), with prices of containers themselves only costing between $1400 - $5000 each (“Storage Container Pricing”).

                    <p>
                        Infrastructure already exists to deliver these containers to First Nations, and any materials required to construct them unavailable at the site can be shipped within them. Any unused containers on site can be converted to new living spaces provided they are in a suitable condition.

                        Furthermore, many tiny homes can be run off-grid, since they utilize efficient appliances and unconventional solutions to sewage, electricity, and water yet still provide a comfortable living situation. The below video is an example of a particularly lavish, but tiny home- built for the cost of ~$125,000 CAD, while incurring minimal recurring costs:

                        Since shipping containers are built to be stacked on top of eachother while carrying immense amounts of cargo within them, they are more than apt to support the weight of home living (“14 Things to Know About Building with Shipping Containers”).

                        Shipping container homes are not a new solution to housing in First Nations. Pic Mobert First Nation has begun experimenting with shipping container homes, with solutions that expand from 1 to 3 bedroom dwellings (Ross). These homes are durable enough to withstand temperatures of -60 celcius, contain smart home features, as well as air circulation systems to remove potential mold inducing moisture, meaning they are both practical and modern (Ross). They are affordable too, meaning a load is taken off of both First Nations communities and government assistance.

                    <p>
                        As First Nations members rely on community and kinship (Hanson), shipping container homes can be connected in such a way that keeps the community close to each other. Through motifs like a common sub-community container for activities, degrees of separation can be maintained where the community feels like it lives together, but still contains spaces like bedrooms which convey privacy. These are not available in the traditional nuclear family homes built on reserves, since they are not built with the purpose to integrate communities, instead separating families.

                    <p>
                        Since many First Nations are built on vulnerable land, like Attawapiskat which lies on a flood plain (Simpson), the structures which these homes lie on should be modular. That means, the homes should either lie on a structure that removes them from risk, or can be transported to exist outside of a risk zone. For shipping container homes in communities like Attawapiskat, they could exist on wooden risers which remove them from any indoor flood risk. For particularly severe events, these homes can then be removed from their risers, and transported away by tow bed, utilizing the inherent transportability of a shipping container (“14 Things to Know About Building with Shipping Containers”).

                    <p>
                        Among the environmental aspects of shipping container living previously mentioned, shipping container living as a philosophy is connected with the environment itself. By living efficiently, less strain is placed on the surrounding ecosystem in terms of carbon output, as well as physical space. Furthermore, efficient living means a more cost effective lifestyle, opening up the ability to focus more traditional First Nations lifestyle as there is little focus on earning money to upkeep the home, which also puts less strain on the government if subsidizing the space is needed.

                        I have argued that I believe efficient housing, particularly shipping container homes, offer a low cost lifestyle attainable by First Nations. This is through improvements in environmental, economic, and social factors. As well, I have defined Northern Sustainability as a means to bridge a connection from responding to Simpson's article in a way that addresses some of his core misconceptions while offering viable solutions. Finally, I have responded to Simpsons article in a way that is conscious of Northern Sustainability, and its connection to First Nations living within Canada’s North.
