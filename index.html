                    When initially approaching this project, this quote from the Stockholm Environment Institute inspired the direction I would take in responding to Simpsons editorial - that a sovereign, traditional lifestyle is attainable for First Nations for a low cost. My approach involves particularly investing in efficient environmentally friendly homes to tackle the continuing housing crisis (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6abZ0LFT5CQ">Angus</a>), as well as suggesting ideas to make housing more adaptable to changing conditions particularly in the wake of the rising threat of climate change (<a href="https://stockholmenvironmentinstitute.exposure.co/into-the-blue">Stockholm Environment Institute</a>). For the first portion of this project, I will directly respond to Simpson’s editorial in which I will be arguing why I believe his perspective is flawed. Particularly: a majority of aboriginal Canada is not living in a dream palace; a low cost, traditional, sustainable way of living is attainable on reserve; why it makes sense for communities like Attawapiskat to remain where they are even with external risk factors; and to refute the notion that an isolated community cannot be vibrant and self sustaining. Then, I will be defining what I believe constitutes northern sustainability. Finally, I will discuss how I believe a redux in northern housing could improve environmental, economic, and social factors of living in the north.

                    Historically, the land that First Nations occupy now essentially is a government sanctioned displacement, meaning conditions from within them are less than ideal (<a href=”https://indigenousfoundations.arts.ubc.ca/reserves/.”>Hanson</a>). This lead to disruptions in First Nations, where social networks and kinship systems were disrupted in order to bring together arbitrary families into one community (<a href=”https://indigenousfoundations.arts.ubc.ca/reserves/.”>Hanson</a>). Aboriginal families tend to be extensive and complex, and the housing traditionally found on First Nations is not built to accommodate that, instead modeled after the typical Western family (<a href=”https://indigenousfoundations.arts.ubc.ca/reserves/.”>Hanson</a>). These factors combined with marginalization from the capitalist economy, discriminatory legislation, and reduction of traditional lands, mean practices like fishing and hunting were not viable to support a First Nations family and result in poverty on reserves (<a href=”https://indigenousfoundations.arts.ubc.ca/reserves/.”>Hanson</a>).
